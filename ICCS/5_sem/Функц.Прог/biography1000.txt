Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky was born on December 1, 1792, in Makaryev, Nizhny Novgorod province, Russia. He was an outstanding Russian mathematician and is often regarded as the creator of non Euclidean geometry. His work and ideas laid the foundation for hyperbolic geometry, which profoundly impacted mathematics and science. In 1807, he enrolled at Kazan University, where he studied under Professor Martin Bartels, initially focusing on mathematics and later on physics. In 1826, he published his groundbreaking work, On the Principles of Geometry, which outlined the fundamentals of a new geometric system. Lobachevsky proposed that alternative geometries could exist without following Euclid's parallel postulate, which revolutionized the mathematical world. His contributions gained recognition only after his death, and today, Lobachevskys name is associated with one of the most influential theories in mathematics. Besides his theoretical work, Lobachevsky served as rector at Kazan University, where he actively promoted education and science in Russia.
